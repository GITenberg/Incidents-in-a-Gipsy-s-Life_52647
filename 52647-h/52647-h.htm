<p>My idea in writing this little pamphlet is to enlighten the
minds of people as to the mode of living, and the customs of our
tribe; and I think the reader will be convinced that we are not
the desperadoes that some people think, but, on the other hand,
honest living and a christian race; always ready to do
good.&nbsp; To young men especially, if they follow my career
they will find that my success in life is due to being
straight-forward and honest in all my dealings; firm purpose of
mind; and an object to gain; the result is success, and I hope it
may prove a benefit to the rising generation.</p>
<p>Shortly, I shall produce a full Biography of my life.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours faithfully,<br />
GEORGE SMITH.</p>
<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>THE LIFE
OF A GIPSY.</h2>
<p>Many writers have spent months and years of <i>their</i> lives
in studying the language, character, and customs of the Romany
Rye.&nbsp; Many able pens have written volumes on the
subject.</p>
<p>For my part I simply give an unvarnished statement of facts,
as they occur to me, so that my readers may glean some little
information as to the general life and incidents in the career of
a gipsy.</p>
<p>With regard to the language of the Romany, whether heard in
the most distant parts of the globe or in the Liverpool
Exhibition (as spoken by my family), it is the same as in
different counties in the United Kingdom and in different
provinces of continental countries; a slight <i>patois</i> may be
observable, but in the main the initiated know that the Romany
holds its own with the nomadic people the world over.</p>
<p>For character, climate, and circumstances, may in many
instances vary the Gitano, Romany, or Bohemian, as we are called,
but custom (go where the traveller may) remains the same, the
nature and habit of the true Romany prompting him, or her, to a
wandering life, and to revel as it were in nature&rsquo;s
solitude.&nbsp; To begin with, I was born on the 3rd of May,
1830, my birth place being on the common called Mousehold Heath,
Norwich, Norfolk, my parents having but a few months previously
left their old camping ground in Epping Forest, near London.</p>
<p>For many, many years, my ancestors recognised the Forest of
Epping as their head quarters, and to this day at intervals we <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>visit the spot,
a sort of pilgrimage to Mecca as it were; but alas, how different
a form it presents to that which it did in my boyhood&rsquo;s
days.</p>
<p>House dwellers often have remarked as to the life we lead:
many have suggested it to be unhealthy.&nbsp; Now to prove to the
contrary, my dear mother died at the age of 75, and my father at
the age of 81.</p>
<p>I think, speaking of one family only, this will be a
sufficient answer as to whether the life of a gipsy, breathing
nature&rsquo;s own atmosphere, is as good as a dweller in houses
or not.&nbsp; My family consists of eight children&mdash;four
boys and four girls&mdash;the eldest whom is now 28, the youngest
reaching 16.</p>
<p>As a boy, I travelled the greater part of the United Kingdom,
when reaching twelve, my aptitude for trading in horses (thanks
to my father&rsquo;s tuition) began to exhibit itself.&nbsp; My
first business transaction consisted of receiving a present of a
pony.&nbsp; One day, shortly after the Epping Fair of 1842, I was
sent by my parents to the Manor House at Loughton, with some
basket-ware.&nbsp; Being some distance from our camp, one of the
upper servants very kindly attended to my inward wants, and
having packed the silver for the ware, for safety, in a piece of
brown paper, in my breeches pocket, I started off for the
forest.&nbsp; After leaving the lodge, to my astonishment, I
found the lady of the manor which I had just left, coming to
grief down the road.&nbsp; Without the slightest idea of fear,
young as I was, I stopped the pony&mdash;both of us being
down.&nbsp; On rising, I found myself unhurt, the only damage
done being the fright of the lady and her friend, and one of the
shafts of the little carriage broken.&nbsp; My pockets were, as a
rule, a general receptacle for everything, so, in a few minutes,
by the aid of a piece of string, a couple of nails, and a stone
as a hammer, I had repaired the damage, and improvised a curb for
the pony, and saw things straight.&nbsp; Prior to the lady <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>leaving me, she
desired me to drive the pony home, after doing which she
presented me with a crown piece, and seeing me so pleased, she
told the stud groom might have the pony, as she would never trust
it again&mdash;to my great astonishment&mdash;and with my new
possession, and the addition of many thanks, I rode off again for
home, as proud and as happy as any king.&nbsp; The precise spot
being, as I remember, the famous old oak, wherein King Charles
hid in the Forest of Epping&mdash;the tree has long since been a
thing of the past.&nbsp; Many a time have I, in my boyhood, heard
my great-great-grandmother tell our visitors of the time when the
shadow of its branches covered an acre of ground.&nbsp; A
chartered fair has for many years been held on the spot, taking
place on the first Friday in July, and, even now, Londoners may
be seen, on the Sunday after the first Friday, wending their way,
thousands in number, some in conveyances of every sort and style,
some footing it to Epping from the Mile End Road, Whitechapel,
and environs.&nbsp; The Cockneys well attend the one remaining
link of the past, &ldquo;Fairlop Fair.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some few
years since, splendidly built full rigged boats were taken on
trollies by the Limehouse block makers to the fair at Fairlop,
the boats being drawn by splendid teams of grey horses,
beautifully caparisoned, and well decorated with oak leaves, the
drivers and artisans wearing the old-fashioned blue coat, white
hat, and top boots.&nbsp; Even now, in my ears, I remember the
old-fashioned doggrel chorus, sung by them on the spot of the old
oak&rsquo;s resting place&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Charter we have got,<br />
We claim this grand old spot,<br />
Old Fairlop, Fairlop Fair,<br />
This be our refrain,<br />
Shall flourish and flourish again and again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I need not say Fairlop Fair was a little gold mine to the
members of our tribe.&nbsp; The Cockneys to the present day
consider the Gipsies to be part and parcel of the festival and
annual gathering, none being so happy as the favoured ones who
could boast of having had tea in a gipsy&rsquo;s tent.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>My
horsedealing propensities grew with me as I grew.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the age of 26, I then took to myself a
wife.&nbsp; Long may we both live to be in the future, as in the
past, a comfort to each other.&nbsp; Corinda Lee, daughter of the
then recognised heads of the Lee tribe of Epping Gipsies, mother
of my children and joy of my life, long may we yet travel this
journey of life up hill and down hill together.&nbsp; Our
marriage in the old village of Waltham Abbey brought together
over fifty families of Gipsies for the junketings and sports, so
freely indulged in in the old times, lasting as they did over the
three days.</p>
<p>I had been married but three months when the first offer of
settling down took place.&nbsp; A gentleman named Hewitt, of the
firm of Huggins&rsquo; Brewery Co., for whom I had purchased many
valuable horses, offered to place me in a livery stable then for
sale in Clerkenwell parish, the price for the same being
&pound;1700.&nbsp; I suggested the acceptance, having the chance
on very good terms to pay out of the profits.&nbsp; My wife,
however, flatly declined the, to me, favourable opportunity, her
objection to living amongst chimneys being too great to combat,
like the sailor in the storm pitying the poor landsmen.&nbsp;
Unlike many of her sex, to this day <i>she has not changed her
mind</i>.</p>
<p>Shortly after this I was appointed the head of ten gipsy
families, and I started a tour of the United Kingdom.&nbsp; After
a few days a more orderly company could, I think, be scarcely
organised.&nbsp; Our tents, caravans, horses, and harness, were
greatly admired; trading in our usual form, with baskets of our
own make, and selling horses, we caused at times almost too much
attention, so much so, even at our meals we could not keep people
out of our tents, although located at some distance from the
towns and villages, so I determined to rent or hire fields for
our camping grounds.&nbsp; Even then it was impossible to keep
intruders out; at length a happy idea struck me, viz., to charge
a fee for admission to those wishing to gratify their ofttimes
intrusive curiosity, in <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>doing which I am pleased to say we
were more than successful in a monetary point of view.</p>
<p>Many offers of engagements were made to me; but never liking
the idea of being a servant, I refused them, and as I started so
have I lived&mdash;making a bargain for my requirements, and
being satisfied with my returns.&nbsp; The Romany, doubtless, are
superstitious&mdash;they like to be free.&nbsp; That old customs
still adhere to us, I must admit; our language is our own, and a
true Gitano is as jealous of its possession as his honour.&nbsp;
Nothing can lower one of us more than learning the house-dweller
our Romanis.&nbsp; Strange though it is, whilst listening, as I
have done lately, to the many words I have heard spoken by the
Tamill, Hindoo, and Ceylonese Indians in the Exhibition, we find
numerous words similar to our own, and bearing, as I understand,
the same meaning.</p>
<p>Travelling as I have in nearly every town of note in Great
Britain, it is only natural I should know and be known, I am
pleased to say, in all.&nbsp; I have met and left many friends
whom it is not easy to forget.&nbsp; The Press of the several
places have very kindly expressed an interest in us; so many, in
fact, to repeat would take up too much space in a little book of
this description.&nbsp; Suffice it to say the remarks of the
Liverpool press alone, as attached to these lines will be readily
taken by the reader as the expressions of all, and I here thank
them for the kindly interest they have displayed in me and my
family.&nbsp; Many articles have been written in papers by clever
writers who have made our people a subject of thought as to our
origin, yet it seems to me an unanswered question and a
mystery.</p>
<p>During our travels in Scotland, I hired a field near
Arthur&rsquo;s Seat, Newington, Edinburgh, wherein I gave a
Gipsy&rsquo;s fete and gala.&nbsp; During my three weeks stay
there the amount of admission money came to &pound;700.&nbsp;
Many of the <i>elite</i> of Edinburgh visited us, amongst others
the Duke of Buccleugh and party.&nbsp; At Aberdeen <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>a great
success attended us.&nbsp; In fact in every Scottish town we
visited we were the recipients of many favours, gratefully
remembered.&nbsp; At Dunbar the highest honour ever accorded us
was the visit of our most gracious Sovereign Queen Victoria to
our tents.</p>
<p>Whilst at Oxford, when giving our galas in the field in Binsey
Lane, near the Perch, we were patronised by many of the
Collegians, amongst whom we had a frequent visitor in the person
of the son of the Khedive of Egypt, who evinced great curiosity
as to our people and their habits.&nbsp; At Leeds our galas at
the Cremorne Gardens in 1865, during the Whit Week, brought in
over 70,000 persons; in the same year we exhibited at the Royal
Oak Park, Manchester.&nbsp; Our procession of the entire tribes
filled thirty conveyances, many thousands witnessing our
procession lining the streets as they did from Newton Heath to
Cheadle, both going and returning.&nbsp; In Manchester we
remained one month, our tents being crowded day after day.&nbsp;
In Dublin for some months we held levees in the famous Rotunda
Gardens.</p>
<p>Dr. J. Guinness Beatty, of the Exhibition Staff, well
remembers our success there, he being then Assistant Master of
the Rotunda Hospital; so successful were we, that Mr. James
Dillon, the Dublin Advertising Contractor, offered us &pound;500
for the gate receipts during the latter portion of our stay,
which offer I must add, as with others, was very respectfully
declined.&nbsp; Whilst in Ireland my time was fully occupied by
purchasing horses for the French and Belgian Armies, an
occupation now followed by my eldest son and my brother, who
visit every large fair held there.&nbsp; After travelling Ireland
for over five years, so contented was my brother with the
reception accorded us, that he decided to remain, and is now
permanently settled in his encampment on the Circular Road,
Dublin, carrying out his calling as a Horse Dealer.&nbsp; Among
many of our patrons and visitors, I may mention Lady Butler,
Lords Mayo and Clonmel, who always exhibited towards us a genial
and kindly interest.&nbsp; During my stay in Ireland I <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>must mention
the pleasure I feel at the advancement in their education my
children received by visiting the Marlboro&rsquo; Street Schools
in Dublin.&nbsp; Many times have I in England extended my stay in
various towns for the sake of educating them, and it is with
pleasure I feel in having done so, it will assuredly be to their
interest and welfare.&nbsp; Knowing as I do that when a boy, all
we of the Gipsy tribe read from and of was &ldquo;Nature&rsquo;s
own book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the years I have travelled I have held conversations
with many wishful of learning our language.&nbsp; Some have
gained a slight knowledge of our lore, but, I am pleased to say,
not from my family.&nbsp; In many instances when they (the would
be learners) have spoken to me, I have heard them use terms
clearly showing them to be the most gullible of the gulled.</p>
<p>Seeing the announcements of the International Exhibition of
Liverpool, stating it was the intention of the Executive Council
to present originals and models of the different means of
travelling as used in past and present times, I ventured to
address a letter, asking to become an exhibitor of my caravan and
tent, within which I and my family have travelled the greater
portion of the United Kingdom.&nbsp; Thanks to their
consideration, permission was kindly given me to erect my
encampment on the south east corner, through their General
Superintendent, Samuel Lee Bapty, Esq.</p>
<p>Soon after our entry on the ground, we had the distinguished
honour of a visit from the Mayor and Mayoress (Sir David and Lady
Radcliffe), and several members of the Executive Council, all of
whom expressed the warmest satisfaction with their reception.</p>
<p>During our stay at the Exhibition I was honoured by a visit
from His Royal Highness Prince Victor of Hohenlohe, who, in
company with Sir A. B. Walker, Bart., and a select party from <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Gateacre
Grange, visited my tent, and had his fortune predicted by my
wife.&nbsp; The Prince professed himself delighted with the
glimpse afforded him of tent life, and on his return to St.
James&rsquo;s Palace, was kind enough to write me an autograph
letter, assuring me of the deep gratification which his reception
had afforded him, and giving me a most pressing invitation to
visit him at his estate of St. Brino, near Ascot, whenever I
found myself in that neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Among other interesting momentoes which I preserve, not so
much for their intrinsic value as for their pleasing
associations, is a half-crown presented to me by the Earl of
Lathom, on visiting my tent.&nbsp; It bears the following
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Earl of Lathom,<br />
Lord High Chamberlain,<br />
September 25, 1886.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor is the least gratifying token of my connection with the
Liverpool Exhibition, a memorial presented to me by the Hindoo
and Cingalese Indians, on their departure to their own
shores.&nbsp; Poor exiles from their native land!&nbsp; They
assured me in the touching document above alluded to that were it
not for my constant kindness to them, they would not have been
able to endure their existence in this country, but when in the
company of myself and family, they fancied themselves once more
in their own far-off home.</p>
<p>I shall ever look back upon my stay at the Liverpool
Exhibition as one of the brightest and happiest pages in my
life.</p>
<p>I could go on, but the printer&rsquo;s boy says he thinks I
have said enough for the few pages this little emanation from
yours obediently should occupy, but I cannot say &ldquo;good
bye&rdquo; without expressing a few sentiments on this, the past
subject of my life, by adding that as the sere and yellow leaf
creeps over me, I think and often dream of the many well loved
spots on this beautiful land I have visited in my boyhood&rsquo;s
days when all was health, <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>glee and happiness.&nbsp; Now, alas!
where are they?&nbsp; Gone!&nbsp; The busy work of the builders
has covered those places once so dear to me.&nbsp; After even a
short absence I seek a place once so well known and loved, to
find what? a block of houses thereon, and the fairy-like home I
have travelled far to see, vanished in the past.&nbsp; For the
future, what bodes; fresh fields and pastures new! is an old and
true saying, with me, as with others, so must it be, but where
can I find those scenes I cannot forget; scenes and times where
one fiftieth of the world&rsquo;s goods now obtainable was all
that was necessary to exist in peace and plenty.&nbsp; Smoky
chimneys, the roaring of machinery and noise of mills, never
dreamed of in days gone by, now meet my sight and ears; oh! how
different.&nbsp; Perhaps my readers may think I am getting
sentimental; perhaps so; if so, kindly forgive,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your very obedient servant, GEORGE
SMITH.</p>
<p>Gipsy Encampment, International Exhibition, Liverpool,
1886.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<h2><i>Extract from the</i> &ldquo;<i>Liverpool
Courier</i>,&rdquo; <i>June</i> 16<i>th</i>, 1886.</h2>
<p>The King and Queen (Mr. George Smith and Mrs. Smith) were
&ldquo;at home,&rdquo; and they and their four comely daughters
were the cynosure of all eyes.&nbsp; A distinguishing feature of
these &ldquo;Epping Forest&rdquo; Gipsies is their extreme
cleanliness.&nbsp; Their tent is scrupulously neat and tidy, its
appointments are comfortable not to say luxurious, and the
caravan reveals the snug sleeping chamber of the daughters of
their majesties.&nbsp; Fortune-telling is not the stock-in-trade
of the tribe, but the dark-skinned &ldquo;Gitanos&rdquo; do not
absolutely refuse to have their palms crossed if credulous ladies
will insist in peering into the future.&nbsp; We understand that
these descendants of Romany Ri have had the honour of appearing
before the Queen in Dunbar, Scotland, and although the King does
not impress one by his tawny skin he is a genuine ruler and
speaks Romany.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<h2><i>Extract from the</i> &ldquo;<i>Liverpool
Review</i>,&rdquo; <i>June</i> 19<i>th</i>, 1886.</h2>
<p>The poor Laplanders have now to play second fiddle to another
wandering tribe whose origin is lost in the mists of
antiquity.&nbsp; Ever since their celebrated moonlight flit the
little northerners had been under a cloud, but their social
extinction has been completed by the advent of the &ldquo;Epping
Forest Gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; The King and Queen of these nomads
bear the prosaic name of Smith.&nbsp; Nevertheless they claim to
be in the line of descent of &ldquo;Romany Ri.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
an open question whether the Gitano complexion&mdash;<a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>the tawny
complexion, the vellum of the pedigree they claim&mdash;cannot be
whitened by partaking of gin and water in unfair
proportions.&nbsp; This result is sometimes brought about among
certain vagabond followers of Isis, but it would be the height of
injustice to suggest that such retributive facial pallor can be
laid to the account of Mr. George Smith, the ruler of the
Exhibition gipsy encampment.&nbsp; The absence of swarthiness in
his Majesty&rsquo;s case must be attributed to other causes, for
if rumour is correct we believe the monarch is a staunch
teetotaler.&nbsp; Like the great majority of Bohemians, he is
addicted to trafficking in horses, while his Royal consort and
her young princesses do a good business in basket selling and
fortune telling.&nbsp; The Queen is well known in the
neighbourhood of Everton, hers being one of the most familiar
figures to those who are in the habit of travelling to town in
trams.&nbsp; For some time past she has chosen Liverpool as her
winter residence, pitching her camp on the waste ground near
Walton Breck, and during the absence of her lord and master in
Ireland her caravan has been the resort of credulous nursemaids
and na&iuml;ve servant girls.&nbsp; A more respectable tribe than
that of the Smiths never trod the open heath.&nbsp; They might be
objected to as being a little too genteel.&nbsp; The interior of
their camp is more like a Turkish divan than the good old
smoke-begrimed vagrant habitation.&nbsp; Indeed they are so
highly civilised as to boast of the patronage of Queen Victoria,
who it appears paid them a special visit in Scotland.&nbsp;
Another instance of the process of modern refinement on these
Pharaohites is that they occupy exactly the same position as the
other hirers of stands&mdash;they have paid for the privilege of
showing their peculiar method of travelling and mode of
life.&nbsp; Unlike the Laps, they have not been engaged as one of
the attractions of the Exhibition, and on coming forward on their
own account they display a business enterprise which does credit
to their commercial instincts.&nbsp; On Whit Monday they did a
roaring trade, many ladies of social standing persisting in
having their fortunes told&mdash;&ldquo;just for the fun of the
thing, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; The female gipsies were attired in
gaudy garments and quite captivated crowds of young
&ldquo;mashers,&rdquo; who had come to see what they were
like.&nbsp; For the moment the new comers are all the rage, and
have snuffed out the blighted Laplanders.</p>

<p>Her Majesty is not the only Royal visitor who has honoured the
Exhibition with her presence.&nbsp; Another has made his
appearance lately and set up what I suppose must be styled his
&ldquo;Palace&rdquo; near Cross&rsquo;s Indian Pavillion, and in
the middle of what may be called a quagmire.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;palace&rdquo; of course is not a very imposing erection,
the only difference between it and an ordinary gipsy tent being
that it is a little larger and that the stuff with which it is
covered is red in colour, the accommodation being supplemented by
a travelling caravan which is decidedly more gaily painted than
such vehicles usually are.&nbsp; His Majesty is not likely to
suggest to any one the phrase &ldquo;every inch a king,&rdquo;
his appearance being more like that of a gamekeeper, though it
was sufficient to attract a large crowd of starers, who, however,
showed no disposition to have their fortunes told, probably
fancying that they knew them well enough already.&nbsp; This was
the more remarkable as King Smith had been callen upon by the
Queen while in Scotland, and he might therefore claim to be a
Royal fortune teller, &ldquo;by appointment&rdquo; with more
accuracy than is generally observed by those using the
phrase.</p>

Courier</i>,&rdquo; <i>June</i> 19<i>th</i>, 1886.</h2>
<p>Whence came those guests who, unknown and uninvited, migrated
into Europe in the fifteenth century?&nbsp; This question, which
has puzzled the fertile minds of many historians, was the one
that naturally presented itself to me as I wended my way to the
gipsy encampment in the grounds of the great International
Exhibition.&nbsp; I confess I had no poetic or sentimental ideas
in regard to the tribes who own Bohemia as their
birthplace.&nbsp; On the contrary, I was afflicted with the
common prejudice that these nomadic individuals were nothing more
nor less than itinerant thieves and natural vagabonds, whose
existence is a social anomaly, and who constitute a standing
protest against the rigour of our game laws.&nbsp; The entrance
to the red cloth-covered tent was surrounded by a crowd whose
curiosity appeared to be as insatiable as their credulity; and it
was with no small difficulty that I succeeded in breaking through
the serried ranks of the gaping throng.&nbsp; The whole aspect of
the place was totally different from the conventional notion of a
gipsy camp.&nbsp; The public picture to themselves a few
dilapidated and ragged shanties, begrimed by smoke, and worn by
long service; a like number of painted and bedizened carts,
shaggy, unkempt, and ill-tended horses, and an indefinite number
of dark-eyed, dark-skinned children.&nbsp; But here the
conditions are entirely reversed.&nbsp; The interior presented an
air of oriental luxury.&nbsp; A rich carpet covered the floor;
cushioned seats invited to repose; and there was not wanting
other accessories to remind one of the sybaritic elegance of a
Turkish divan.&nbsp; The squalid children were not there, but in
their stead appeared a bevy of handsome damsels, with Gitano
complexions.&nbsp; The comely girls were attired in robes of the
brightest hues, scarlet, pink, and yellow, and from their ears
depended large silver rings, which imparted to them a dashing
Bohemian mien.&nbsp; But it is on beholding the King and Queen of
these Pharoahites that one&rsquo;s preconceived ideas sustain the
rudest shock.&nbsp; I must confess to a feeling of disappointment
on being ushered into the presence of the King.&nbsp; Instead of
being confronted with a picturesque old gentleman of dirty and
forbidding look, I saw before me a perfectly respectable
middle-aged man with a quiet self-possessed air, and wearing the
very unimposing garments prescribed by nineteenth century
civilisation.&nbsp; There was nothing striking about his bearing,
and I searched in vain for any indications of royal
characteristics.&nbsp; His Majesty may be a true descendant of
&ldquo;Romany Ri&rdquo;; he may boast of the blood of the genuine
Zingari, but he certainly does not show it in the &ldquo;tawny
skin, the vellum of the pedigree they claim.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
countenance strikes one as being more English than Egyptian, and
were it not for a slight swarthiness observable about the eyes no
one would suspect that he had the remotest connection with the
&ldquo;vagabond followers of Isis.&rdquo;&nbsp; His Royal
Consort, who at the time I entered was engaged at the homely
occupation of peeling potatoes.&nbsp; The Queen is much
darker.&nbsp; Indeed her visage has assumed a saffron hue, and
amongst her own people she must have been regarded as a very
prepossessing specimen twenty years ago.&nbsp; The King received
me with the utmost courtesy, and on being informed of the object
of my visit insisted on me taking a chair while he squatted on
the carpet.&nbsp; His Majesty was not only ready but eager to
supply the information which I required.</p>
<p>May I be favoured with your name?&nbsp; Oh,
certainly&mdash;George Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It strikes me I have heard that name before,&rdquo; was
the comment which instinctively came to the lips, but I
refrained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you may say that is a common name for a Bohemian
like me <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>to
bear, but I can tell you that the Smith&rsquo;s are as old a
tribe as the Stanleys, the Lovells, the Hernes, and the
Coopers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the extent of your family here?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, the occupants of this tent and that covered cart
which you see outside are myself and my wife, four daughters, and
their two female cousins, and four sons there&rdquo;&mdash;and he
pointed with his finger to a group of strapping young fellows who
had just entered the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you trace your descent far back?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this point his Royal Consort
exclaimed with evident pride, &ldquo;I can remember my great
grandmother.&nbsp; She and her tribe never lived out of
tents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King: &ldquo;You see, sir, its a kind of a mystery where
we came from.&nbsp; Some say we are from the Rekkybites
(Rechabites), and others say as how we are the lost tribes.&nbsp;
It has been a great puzzle as to where we have
originated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you speak the gipsy language?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, to be sure.&nbsp; We talk Romany.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as
if to convince me of the truth of his assertion he addressed a
few words to the Queen in that mysterious lingo which I regret
not to have been able to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is said that, like the Red men, you gipsies are
being civilised out of being.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Its this way,
sir.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s good and bad among us.&nbsp; Some wander
about the country, and by their depredations get a character
that&rsquo;s not very nice; but now we are more prosperous than
the generality of our class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I enquire what is your principal source of
income?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, bless you, I and my sons do a
great deal in the way of horse dealing; and we don&rsquo;t employ
our idle time, like some of the strollers, in tinkering.&nbsp; We
go to Ireland very often and buy horses for the French Army, and
the English Government as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you allow me to ask whether you practice
fortune-telling at all?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, the fact is we
don&rsquo;t go in for that.&nbsp; But if ladies insist, we
don&rsquo;t object to do it.&nbsp; My wife and the girls tell
fortunes when they are asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given the mysteries of gipsy life, and the curiosity of
the public, I suppose your camp is crowded every day since your
arrival?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, sir, on Whit-Monday we were so
full as almost to be suffocated.&nbsp; The people came in droves,
and the entrance was blocked up with them all the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It strikes me that I have seen her Majesty in the
neighbourhood of Everton for some time past?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, you see, we have been camped there, but we come from
Epping Forest.&nbsp; The Queen visited us when we were in Dunbar,
Scotland.&nbsp; And if we weren&rsquo;t real gipsies Her Majesty
would not have come to see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King at this juncture said he should be exceedingly
obliged if I would put in the papers the fact that their
habitation was scrupulously neat and clean, and that the sanitary
arrangements were of an unexceptional character&mdash;which I
told him I should have much pleasure in doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another thing which you might mention
too,&rdquo; he added in a whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
herd together, higgledy-piggledy, like some wanderers.&nbsp; My
wife and I pass the night in that end of the tent, and at the
opposite end, which is curtained off, my boys sleep.&nbsp; And as
for the girls, they occupy the caravan.&rdquo;&nbsp; His Majesty
then conducted me to the caravan outside, and showed me a
veritable boudoir for comfort and elegance.&nbsp; He was careful
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>to point
out every detail of the well-appointed vehicle, and to exhibit
the gee-gaws and showy dresses which the ladies wore on gala
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, sir, some people think that we gipsies are a
little loose in our morals.&nbsp; But I can tell you it&rsquo;s
nothing of the sort.&nbsp; We are very particular people.&nbsp;
Our daughters&rsquo; virtue is very dear to us, and rather than
see them injured we would sooner see them die.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
by the powerfully self-restrained manner of Mr. Smith, I could
see that he meant what he said.</p>
<p>In reply to the question as to whether he really preferred
gipsying to the ordinary mode of life, he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
our regular way of living, and if you gave me the grandest house,
I would not give up my camp for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Queen chimed in, &ldquo;Our ancestors always lived in
tents, and so shall we.&nbsp; I am happier as I am than if I was
in a palace.&nbsp; Indeed, I would not live in one, and no more
would my daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Observing an ancient-looking parrot in a gaudy cage, I
ventured to ask if it belonged to the family.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless
your life,&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;we have had that
&rsquo;ere bird for more than fifteen years.&nbsp; It knows our
ways, and can talk Romany.&nbsp; But it only speaks when the
spirit moves it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Just at that moment Poll was in one
of her most taciturn moods, and could not be induced to open her
beak, but no doubt, like the traditional bird of that ilk, she
thought the more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any history of your tribe or biographical
records of yourself?&rdquo; I inquired; to which his Majesty
pathetically answered: &ldquo;Unfortunately I have not.&nbsp; Ah,
if I had only got one-half the accounts that the Scotch reporters
put in about us, they would be worth any money to me just
now.&nbsp; However, I have given some particulars to a gentleman
who is going to put it in a little book for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you permitted to do any trafficking
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, yes, a little.&nbsp; Mr. Bapty
allows us to sell a few fancy baskets, if we like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then perhaps the ladies do not offer insuperable
objections to have their palms crossed?&rdquo;&nbsp; To this soft
impeachment the gipsy monarch only returned a knowing wink, as
much as to say, &ldquo;Why should we not humour the whims of our
fair visitors.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<h2><i>Extract from the</i> &ldquo;<i>Liverpool
Review</i>,&rdquo; <i>June</i> 26<i>th</i>, 1886.</h2>
<p>The gipsies are still the rage at the Exhibition, and each day
King Smith and his Royal consort receive the homage of
well-dressed crowds of lady admirers.&nbsp; With the prestige
gained by the patronage of Queen Victoria, they come with
confidence before a credulous public, and so far their
<i>levees</i> have been pecuniarily successful.&nbsp; Their
cleanly and well ordered encampment was visited this week by the
Mayor and Mayoress, who were much interested, if not edified, by
their interviews with these ultra respectable Bohemians.&nbsp;
Selling little fancy baskets is ostensibly the only traffic
carried on by the olive complexioned family; but this is not
their only stock-in-trade.&nbsp; It is surprising to witness the
large number of <i>graudes dames</i> who enter the tent for the
sole object of having their fortunes told.&nbsp; This strange
curiosity was supposed to exist only amongst domestic servants,
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>but Mary
Jane&rsquo;s mistress seems quite as anxious to dive into the
mysteries of the future.&nbsp; Many ladies feel ashamed to
patronise chiromancy in the Exhibition, but have asked for
private appointments with her Majesty Mrs. Smith.&nbsp; Not a few
in their eagerness to penetrate into futurity conquer their
natural timidity, and boldly enter.&nbsp; In such cases it is an
amusing spectacle to observe the furtive manner in which the
operation is conducted, and how the fair ones make a hurried exit
as if conscious of having done something very foolish and
ridiculous.&nbsp; As a rule it is the Queen whose palm is
crossed, but some young mashers prefer having their fortunes told
by one of the princesses.</p>

<h2><i>Extract from the</i> &ldquo;<i>Glasgow Weekly
Mail</i>,&rdquo; <i>Saturday</i>, <i>May</i> 21, 1892.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>GIPSY KING IN GLASGOW</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">IN A TENT OF ISHMAEL.</p>
<p>Lord Rosebery&rsquo;s statement last Friday, in the St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Halls, that there were 138,000 vagrants in
Scotland, persons who did nothing but roam the country and admire
the scenery, induced me to pay the Gipsy King, Mr. George, a
visit.&nbsp; His Majesty, with family, are presently located in
Glasgow, in Great Western road.&nbsp; I found Mr. Smith in his
tent, a large and commodius structure, some eight feet in height,
the frame of strong ash girders covered with a dark purple
cloth.&nbsp; The place answering to the kitchen is near the
entrance, and the family had just finished breakfast a few
minutes before I put in an appearance.&nbsp; They do not sit on
chairs at meals, but squat in tailor-like fashion on the floor,
and in the same attitude that I have seen American Indians do in
their wigwams.&nbsp; The members of the Smith family are
dark-eyed and dark-haired.&nbsp; The women have the true Zingara
beauty of face, olive-tinted forehead, sharp glittering eyes, and
their black hair, that peculiar metallic hue which one sees on
the wings of the dusky raven.&nbsp; The women are fond of
jewellery, heavy earrings fall on their necks, and their small
copper-coloured hands sparkle with rings.&nbsp; A collie bitch, a
cat, and a canary were the only animals about the hut.&nbsp; No
part of the show ground is kept so scrupulously clean as that
allocated to the Gipsies.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith is a general type of the race&mdash;gentlemanly,
intelligent, and courteous.&nbsp; In years he must be over sixty,
but he is still as straight as a poplar, and wiry and muscular as
a man of thirty, He has in his time been an extensive horse
dealer, and for years made regular visits to Ireland.&nbsp; He
has purchased hundreds of Irish horses and disposed of them in
France and Germany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he said, with an imperial toss of the
head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one of Lord Rosebery&rsquo;s 138,000
vagrants.&nbsp; I belong to a race whose history began in the
twilight of the world, back in a time when lords and dukes were
not dreamt of.&nbsp; I pay a regular license for my caravan, and
when I am moving <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>about over the country I pay, like other gypsies, for
permission to pitch my tent, the same as I do here.&nbsp; There
is no vagrancy in that.&nbsp; I am unable to say how many gypsies
may be in Scotland and England.&nbsp; Scotch Tinklers&mdash;men
and women who wander about making spoons, soldering pails, and
skellets&mdash;are not gypsies.&nbsp; They are simply
pariahs.&nbsp; There is not a drop of gypsy blood in their
veins.&nbsp; The scotch tinker lived originally in a house, but
abandoned it from various causes.&nbsp; They are a drunken,
useless class of people, these tinkers, but persons will have
them related somehow to us true gypsies.&nbsp; I claim to be
the</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;KING OF THE ENGLISH
GYPSIES,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and act for our people all over Great Britain.&nbsp; Take, for
instance, that question before Parliament recently of the
education of gipsy children.&nbsp; I was in the House of Commons
and examined.&nbsp; Here you see letters from Justin
M&rsquo;Carthy, the President of the Local Government Board, and
from a number of Members of Parliament.&nbsp; What are my views,
you ask, on the education of gypsy children?&nbsp; Well, I have
embodied my opinions in a memorial to the Government.&nbsp;
Briefly, this is what I say.&nbsp; Every gipsy child should be
educated, just as I have educated these children there, now men
and women.&nbsp; There is no reason why our children should not
be sent to school.&nbsp; Here, for instance, I will be settled
altogether some six months.&nbsp; If I had children of school
age, do you think it would be a hardship for me to be compelled
to keep them at school?&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp; My opinion is
this, that if a gypsy is located in a place for two days, for a
week, a month or a year, he should be compelled to send his
children to school.&nbsp; There would be no hardship in
that.&nbsp; There is where the gypsy settles always a school in
the neighbourhood.&nbsp; It is only in centres of population that
we can live now.&nbsp; The old romantic days of pitching your
tent in the forest and living on the fruits of the chase are gone
for ever.&nbsp; We can only live, I repeat, where there is
population, and where you have population you must have
schools.&nbsp; Out of six days in the week, no matter how much a
gypsy may travel, his child, if he were anxious to give it merely
the rudiments of education, would at least have two and three
days at school in the week.&nbsp; That is my view, and it seems
to meet with the approval of the Local Government Board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man named George Smith&mdash;no friend of
mine&mdash;of Coalville, has been slandering and defaming our
people for years.&nbsp; He has been making money out of books he
has written about us.&nbsp; I have challenged him scores of times
to prove his statements, but he has never had the courage to meet
me.&nbsp; Amongst other things he says that we</p>
<p style="text-align: center">BURY OUR DEAD ANY WAY</p>
<p>and anywhere.&nbsp; I took the trouble to explode this lie,
and went to London to do it.&nbsp; I obtained from the directors
of cemeteries in England and Scotland certificates as to our mode
of burial.&nbsp; These certificates in every instance disproved
Smith&rsquo;s slanders, but he has not had the courage to
withdraw them.&nbsp; Why, we have even here a burying ground,
which has been procured from Sir Archibald Campbell.&nbsp; My
sister is buried there, and she brought her son all the way from
Galway, in Ireland, to be interred here.&nbsp; That does not look
like neglecting our dead, does it?&nbsp; Then this man from
Coalville says that we are filthier than the pigs.&nbsp; Does
this little place of mine look like a pig-stye?&nbsp; The real
gipsy, the dweller in tents, is cleaner than those who reside in
houses.&nbsp; If a dog should lick any plate or vessel it is not
afterwards used, but is destroyed or disposed of.&nbsp; Is that
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>like the
conduct of persons who, according to this man, are swinish in
their habits?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We call ourselves Protestants of the Church of England,
and are christened, married, and buried at the church nearest to
us.&nbsp; We have not joined a church in Glasgow yet, but in
Edinburgh we went to Dr. Rankin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a death takes place in the camp the corpse is laid
out on the ground.&nbsp; The body is usually kept for a week, and
during that time none of us go to sleep.&nbsp; A light is kept
burning and we</p>
<p style="text-align: center">EAT NO MEAT</p>
<p>until the grave closes over the departed.&nbsp; All that we
take in the way of food is a cup of tea, or a bit of dry
bread.&nbsp; We pay great reverence to our dead, more so than any
other race on the face of the earth.&nbsp; There is a custom
universal among our people, namely, of refraining from some usage
or indulgence in honour of the departed.&nbsp; What I mean is
this.&nbsp; Suppose the deceased was addicted to drink, it is
common for the deceased&rsquo;s brother to never taste liquor
during the remainder of his life.&nbsp; That will do for an
example.&nbsp; At our wakes no whisky is drunk, and a silence
deep as the grave pervades the tents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing peculiar about our marriages.&nbsp; We
just go to the minister, or else get a license.&nbsp; I must say
that</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THE SHERIFF&rsquo;S LICENSE</p>
<p>is the most popular and the least expensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty years ago it was deemed an unheard of thing for a
royal gipsy to marry a person of another race.&nbsp; In fact it
was treason.&nbsp; To-day, among the genuine gipsies, it is
nothing short of a crime.&nbsp; I have myself experienced the
effects of this inter-marrying, and I tell you that it has not
been satisfactory.&nbsp; One of my children has gone outside of
our people.&nbsp; I make the statement, fearless of
contradiction, that our people, in the aggregate, are the most
moral that you can find.&nbsp; Search the</p>
<p style="text-align: center">CRIMINAL RECORDS OF THE CENTURY</p>
<p>and you will not find an instance where a gipsy has stained
his hands with human blood.&nbsp; He may have been hung for
stealing a sheep or a horse, but not for committing a murder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About this fortune-telling, we believe that God
Almighty has endowed our people with the faculty for foretelling
events, and looking into the future.&nbsp; Strangers, of course,
will laugh at that statement, but nevertheless, we maintain that
it is correct.&nbsp; But fortune-telling is only a small part of
the gipsy equipment.&nbsp; We do not attach much importance to
it.&nbsp; We are of the dusky race, whose history began &ldquo;on
the dawn of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; John Bunyan was one of our
people.&nbsp; Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity, was a
gipsy, and on Christmas Day we burn an ash tree in honour of Him,
because He lived and died one of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir, I&rsquo;m not one of Lord Rosebery&rsquo;s
vagrants.&nbsp; If I am, then the Christ which Lord Rosebery
professes to worship was also a vagrant.&nbsp; He too wandered
wearily over the world, and was more homeless than the wild dove,
which has a nest.&nbsp; Good morning.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
